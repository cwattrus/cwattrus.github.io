  <p><a href="http://support.thoughtworks.com/entries/26300870-Mingle-what-we-ve-moved-to-done-since-November">In my last post</a>, I recapped the awesome features we&#8217;ve &#8220;moved to done&#8221; (and deployed!) since November.</p>
<p>Now, lets take a look at the new awesomeness that is currently in progress (“in dev”) and will be making their way to your Mingle site in the next few months.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zS-mrCw6iSX1tbaXLc7_iAvEW92S9XJAH45GMhSGFiXTldywm_j1DhhNHyXwmEE59lRVzUkKfnbWdKI4HhdOnTBRRRCojZc4sGRJvo3XlxG6m9ia4c9BzI-L5Q" title="In dev card wall" alt="In dev card wall" /></p>
<h3><a href="http://support.thoughtworks.com/entries/26045305-Avatars-on-your-card-wall-Coming-soon">Avatars on the card wall</a></h3>
<p>The card wall is home for any team. But your smiling faces (or dancing cat avatars) were missing from the card wall&#8230;until now! Well, as soon as we hit &#8216;deploy&#8217; :)</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ggUheuWPqvxfRPk6OBj-mM8-gcTVvZQm8be6LiDrqFe_tc-hTmww6blNY5g2TsXAAFKUZ6bKh2FR7NbJi6QGtmwBuUBzx7gPCVZSIIefiCjDQtAAId6ow0dvHw" title="Your team now more visibile" alt="Your team now more visibile" /></p>
<h3>In-place card editing</h3>
<p>Just had a conversation and need to make a quick edit to a card? Soon, you won&#8217;t have to leave the card wall to do it. Just click the card and make your edits, right from the wall.</p>
<p>Play with our prototype for this feature. What do you think? Love it? Hate it? We want your feedback to get it right.</p>

<h3>Invite users via email</h3>
<p>Yeah, we know adding users in Mingle has been a pain: filling out their profile, setting their password, etc. Do you wish you could just invite them via email? We hear you! Self-service <span class="caps">FTW</span>.</p>

<h3>Open a card with 1-click anywhere in Chrome (<strong>Already live!</strong>)</h3>
<p>Our newest team member, Craig Wattrus (South African, designer, baker, and coffee lover), created this handy-dandy Chrome extension that allows you open a card from any tab in Chrome simply by entering the card number.</p>
<p>Want to contribute and help make this extension even better? It&#8217;s on Github!</p>

<h3>Push notifications about the latest and greatest in Mingle</h3>
<p>Wondering why you have to check our Announcements page, our Twitter feed, or read a mass email to learn about new stuff in Mingle? Yeah, we know. We&#8217;ll soon be introducing push notifications in Mingle so you are always up-to-date on the latest and greatest. We promise not to be annoying about it, though!</p>
<h3>A fresh look for 2014</h3>
<p>Mingle&#8217;s getting a makeover. Not only will it look much cleaner and fresher, it will also be faster and easier to use.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for reading!</strong></p>
<p>In my next post, I&#8217;ll share more about our key themes and goals for the year, and introduce you to the team and how we work.</p>
<p>More soon!</p>
