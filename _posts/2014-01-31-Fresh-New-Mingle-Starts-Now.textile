<p>
  You saw a preview of the new visual direction we'll be taking Mingle this year in my last post. Yeah, it's going to be pretty different but awesome.
</p>
<p>
  We'll be sharing more soon about the what and, more interestingly, the why.
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, we've deployed a significant first step: lightening the colors up and flattening the UI. And no more orange! (The locations of buttons, features, etc hasn't changed...yet.)
</p>
<p><strong>The transformation starts today...</strong></p>
